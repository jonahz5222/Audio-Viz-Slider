# Audio Viz Slider

Challenge 2 for OO 4330

Using an existing JavaFX media player application project, AudioViz, implement the ability to use the slider above the visualizer to change the playhead position. The slider currently changes the playhead position as the media plays. The left end of the slider represents 0.0 time and the right end represents the time of the end of the song. The user is to be able to slide the slider to any time between 0.0 and the end of the song and the media player is to play from the time position selected. In addition, the numerical values displayed after Length: and Current: in the user interface are to only display one digit after the decimal point.
